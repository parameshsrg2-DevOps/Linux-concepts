**/bin**
Contains basic Linux commands required for system operation and recovery.
Example: ls, cp, mv, cat, bash, grep, etc.

**/boot:**

Stores everything needed to boot Linux.
Contains:
* Linux kernel (vmlinuz-*)
* Initial RAM disk (initramfs-*)
* GRUB bootloader files

**/dev:**

Special files representing hardware and disks.
```
/dev/nvme0n1   → root EBS volume  
/dev/nvme1n1   → extra EBS disk  
/dev/null     → trash device  
/dev/random   → random number generator
/dev/tty	Terminal device (current session)
/dev/usb	USB device interface (usually managed by subdirs)
/dev/input/eventX Keyboard
/dev/input/mice Mouse
```

* Linux treats everything as a file, including hardware devices.
* The files in /dev are not regular files; they are special device files created and managed by the kernel 

**/etc:**

The /etc directory in Linux contains system-wide configuration files and directories. These files control the behavior of the system, services, and installed applications.
For example
```
* /etc/passwd
* /etc/group
* /etc/systemd/system
* /etc/nginx
```

**/home:**

The /home directory is where all regular users’ personal files and settings are stored. Each user gets a subdirectory inside /home, named after their username.

User settings	Hidden "dotfiles" like .ssh, .bashrc, .profile, .config/ store per-user settings.

**lib:**

The /lib directory contains essential shared libraries needed by the core system binaries in /bin and /sbin. These libraries are similar to .dll files in Windows or .dylib in macOS.

For example When you run a basic command like ls, the system:
1. Finds /bin/ls
2. Loads necessary libraries from /lib
3. Executes the binary with support from those libraries

**/lib64:**

The /lib64 directory contains 64-bit shared libraries that are essential for running 64-bit binaries, especially those located in /bin and /sbin.

On 64-bit Linux systems, libraries are separated by architecture to avoid conflicts:

Directory	    Purpose
/lib	        Contains 32-bit libraries (on multilib systems)
/lib64	        Contains 64-bit libraries (default on 64-bit systems)

This separation helps the OS load the correct library version depending on whether a program is 32-bit or 64-bit.

**/media:**

The /media directory is used to automatically mount external storage devices such as:

* USB drives
* CD/DVDs
* SD cards
* External hard drives

When a user named alice inserts a USB named MyUSB, the system might mount it as:

```shell
/media/alice/MyUSB/
```
Inside that directory, you’ll see the contents of the USB.
**NOTE:** This media is mostly for desktop auto mount environments. It is like plug and play as we see in windows.

**Flow When You Plug in a USB:**

* Linux detects hardware and assigns it a device file like /dev/sdb1
* An auto-mount tool mounts it under /media/username/MyUSB/
* You access your files through /media, not /dev

**/mnt:**

The /mnt directory is a standard mount point used for temporarily mounting filesystems, such as:

* External hard drives
* USB drives (manually mounted)
* Network filesystems (NFS, SMB)
* ISO images

It’s primarily intended for manual or admin use.

Manual Mounts	    Used by system administrators to mount filesystems temporarily
No Auto-mounting	Unlike /media, this is not used by desktop auto-mount tools
Testing or recovery	Often used during system recovery or file system testing

**/opt:**

The /opt directory stands for “optional” and is used to install third-party software that is not part of the default Linux distribution.

Feature	            Description
💾 Third-party apps	Used for software not managed by the package manager
🗂️ Self-contained	Each application has its own subdirectory, keeping things isolated
📥 Manual installs	Ideal for software downloaded directly (e.g., Chrome, MATLAB)

```bash
/opt/
├── google/
│   └── chrome/
├── myapp/
│   ├── bin/
│   ├── lib/
│   └── config/
```

**When to Use /opt**

* Installing commercial software (e.g., Oracle, VMware, Zoom)
* Managing applications outside the OS package manager (apt, yum, dnf)
* Deploying self-contained apps or custom-built binaries

**/proc:**

The /proc directory is a virtual filesystem (not a real one on disk) that provides a real-time interface to kernel and process information.

Think of it as a window into the running Linux kernel.

| Path            | Description                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `/proc/cpuinfo` | Info about CPU(s)                    |
| `/proc/meminfo` | Memory usage                         |
| `/proc/uptime`  | System uptime                        |
| `/proc/version` | Kernel version                       |
| `/proc/[PID]/`  | Info about a running process by PID  |

**/root:**

The /root directory is the home directory for the root user, who is the superuser (administrator) on a Linux system.

Do not confuse /root with the root (/) directory — / is the root of the entire filesystem, while /root is the root user’s home folder.

**/run:**

The /run directory is a temporary filesystem used to store runtime data for processes and services after boot, such as:

* Process ID (PID) files
* Lock files
* Socket files

| Feature                   | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⚡ **Volatile**            | Stored in **RAM** (`tmpfs`) — **cleared at every reboot**         |
| 🧰 **Used by services**   | Systemd, udev, network manager, and other daemons store data here |
| 🕒 **Early availability** | Available **very early in boot**, even before `/var` is mounted   |

* /proc/<pid>/: Shows live process data (real-time, kernel-managed).
* /run/*.pid: Text files created by services to store their own PID for tracking or control.

**/sbin:**

The /sbin directory contains essential system binaries that are primarily intended for the system administrator (root). These binaries are crucial for system boot, repair, and maintenance.

Example: fsck, iptables, reboot, iptables, init, etc.

**/srv:**

The /srv directory stands for "service" and is used to store data served by system services such as:

* Web servers (httpd, nginx)
* FTP servers
* File sharing services

Often structured like /srv/ftp, /srv/www, /srv/nfs

Not Always Used
* Optional: Not all Linux distributions or setups use /srv.
* Customizable: Some admins prefer /var/www, /usr/share/nginx/html, /home/ftp, or mount points elsewhere.

**/swap:**

In Linux, /swap is not a directory, but rather a swap space used as virtual memory to help manage the system's memory resources.

Swap space can be located either in a swap partition (a dedicated disk partition) or a swap file (a file on the filesystem). It allows the system to offload less frequently used memory pages when the physical RAM is full.

**/tmp:**
The /tmp directory is used for temporary file storage. It's a standard location where programs and users can store temporary files that are required only for short-term use.


🗑️ Temporary Storage	Used to store temporary files created by programs or users
🛠️ Program usage	    Programs often create files here that they don’t need permanently
📂 Writable by all	   It’s a world-writable directory, meaning any user or process can create files

Many systems are configured to clear the contents of /tmp on reboot, or periodically through cron jobs.

**/usr:**

The /usr directory is one of the core system directories in Linux. It contains user-related programs and data that are not required for the basic system to run, but are essential for most applications.

📂 Common Subdirectories of /usr
Directory	Description
/usr/bin	User binaries - contains most executable programs for general users
/usr/lib	Libraries - stores shared libraries required by programs
/usr/include	Contains C header files for development
/usr/share	Contains shared data, such as documentation and icons
/usr/local	Locally installed software (software manually installed by the admin)

**/var:**

Variable Data. Holds data that grows and changes.
Key subfolders:
```
/var/log          → system & app logs  
/var/lib          → Docker, MySQL, Jenkins, kubelet  
/var/spool        → mail, cron  
/var/lib/docker   → Docker home folder
```

* Fills up the fastest
* Should be on separate EBS in production
* Needs log rotation
